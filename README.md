RoseLoot 是一个高度可配置的自定义战利品插件，允许对生物、方块、钓鱼、箱子、猪灵以物易物、进度、考古、金库和试用刷怪箱进行战利品操作！

### Documentation
Instructions on how to use the plugin and create custom loot tables can be found [in our Wiki](https://github.com/Rosewood-Development/RoseLoot/wiki)!

### Support
If there's anything we left out, you have a question, you want to report a bug, or anything else, please [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/MgUsTBK).  We offer any and all support in our server.

### Server Compatibility
RoseLoot is compatible with Spigot and any forks. We recommend using [Paper](https://papermc.io/) to run your server.  CraftBukkit servers will not be compatible with the plugin.

We support Minecraft versions **1.16.5** and newer running **Java 17**.

If you wish to use this plugin on a 1.16.5 server (newer versions do not need this), you will need to use [Paper](https://papermc.io/) (or a fork of Paper), Java 17, and add the flag `-DPaper.IgnoreJavaVersion=true` to your server's startup parameters.
